## Projects
**Random Fourier Features in Hyper-RKHS**
<p style = "margin-top:0;font-size:90%;color:black;"> One can learn a kernel function from data using the mathematical structure of hyper
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (hyper-RKHS), the aim of this project has been to
project the high dimensional structure in hyper-RKHS onto a dense lower dimensional
Fourier basis in order to improve performance. Tested on UCI benchmark datasets</p>
**Option Pricing in Python**
<p style = "font-size:90%;color:black;"> Calibrating both Heston and Bates stochastic volatility models using particle swarm
optimization on option price data pulled from yahoo finance using the yahoo_fin API,
then pricing and hedging exotic options using Monte Carlo simulations.</p>
**Reccomendation system using Graphical Neural Networks (Pytorch)**
<p style = "font-size:90%;color:black;"> By limiting the class of possible transformations in a fully connected neural network to graph convolutions with weights of each diffusion step as the learnable parameter, one can preserve graphical structure naturally occuring in data in order to perform link prediction.  This appraoch was tested by first using the sparsified correlation of movie ratings from a real world database in order to generate a graphical structure and predict link strength for the movie 'Contact'(1997)</p>
